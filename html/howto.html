			<!-- Description -->
			<p><a href='../index.html'>Ripoff Idle</a> is a direct ripoff of as many idle games as I can stuff into 
			one code base. The goal is to get a lot of cookies, and then get some more.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<!-- Cookies -->
			<button onclick='toggleSection(0)'>Cookies</button>
			<div id='section0' style='display: none;'>
				Cookies are the primary currency in Ripoff Idle. You can use them to purchase generators, 
				upgrades and other great things. Your goal is to get a lot of them, like a lot. You can
				click the the big cookie and it willl give you a cookie. <br><small>Cookies contain gluten
				and chocolate. We are not responsible for any content induced harm, or illness due to 
				excess consumption. For any inquiries please call the number 1797693134.</small>

			<!-- Generators -->
			<button onclick='toggleSection(1)'>Generators</button>
			<div id='section1' style='display: none;'>
				Generators make your cookies for you, so you don't have to get tendonitis clicking your
				mouse. 1D generators make your cookies directly, 2D generators make 1D generators, 3D make
				2D and so on.  The first (and cheapest) generator is the cursor, which clicks the big cookie
				for you (use your imagination) and the next one is your lovely grandma, who likes to bake
				cookies because that is the stereotype she was coded into, and the rest you can find out
				yourself.

			<!-- Upgrades -->
			<button onclick='toggleSection(2)'>Upgrades</button>
			<div id='section2' style='display: none;'>
				Upgrades are what really speeds up the early game, without them you wouldn't get very far.
				Upgrades each make something in the game faster, easier and better. You unlock new upgrades
				to buy as you go along, and then you can invest your cookies in them to help grow your cookie
				empire even faster.
