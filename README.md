# Ripoff-Idle

Once upon a time I was trying to come up with an idea for an idle game that wasn't just a ripoff of another idle game, so I decided to ripoff not one, but as many idle games as possible, all in one game. So that is what I'm doing.

It starts off like Cookie Clicker, you click the cookie to get cookies. You spend the cookies on buildings, like cursors and grandmas. This is where Antimatter Dimensions comes in, you not only have one kind of cursor but 8 different dimensional cursors, if you've played AD you know how this works. You buy upgrades and earn achievements.

Once you earn enough cookies, you can start getting unfunity points. These boost your cookie production. Then after that, you get unfunity galaxies based on your unfunity points, which make unfunity points give more of a boost. And then when you get enough unfunity galaxies, you can ascend to make galaxy power better. This resets your unfunity points and unfunity galaxies, though.

After getting 1.80e308 cookies, you unlock prestige. Prestige resets all previous content except ascension in exchange for prestige points, which boosts cookie production by a small amount. This can be used to buy new upgrades. Once you get enough prestige points, you unlock the Replication Field. You get replicanti sub-exponentially, and replicanti speeds up time speed very slowly. Replicanti can be used to buy 6 upgrades; increase the time speed boost of replicanti, get more unfunity points, make ascension stronger, passive prestige point gain, get more replicanti, make ascension cheaper, and get more cookies.
